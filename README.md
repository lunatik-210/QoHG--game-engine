###Done:

* Implemented diamond-square alghoritm for map generation
* Developed first visualizator based on PyGame engine
* Added very funny sprites (thanks sagod ~_~)
* Added first vision of game architecture (see docs folder)

###Plans/Tasks:

* Add debug information about current location on the screen (x,y)
* Develop small map
* Implement first version of class GameEngine with some hash map optimization

> Comment: After some thought i've decided implement hashing in separate class named Land
> and I'm amazed because it turns out that map hashing gives some performance and it now moves faster across the map
